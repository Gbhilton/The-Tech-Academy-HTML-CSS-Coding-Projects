# The-Tech-Academy-HTML-CSS-Coding-Projects

The HTML/CSS used in these projects are working towards building my personal portfolio. Each HTML or CSS file contains another skill/value added code that I used to build my portfolio found at Gbhilton.Github.Io.

The largest of the files is a "Space Station" website making use of some Jquery as well.
